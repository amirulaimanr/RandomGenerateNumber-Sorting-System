# RandomGenerateNumber-Sorting-System
Generating random number with sorting algorithm program

The purpose of this program is to generates a random number for creating list of unique
integers that can be sort by implementing sorting algorithm which are merge sort and quick
sort. This project is using simple programming on a local system. This program was code 
using C++ .
